# UWM Clubs and Events: Senior Capstone Project

Welcome to our Senior Capstone Project at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, where our passion for technology meets our commitment to enhancing student life. As Computer Science majors, we've embarked on an ambitious journey to create a pivotal resource for our campus community â€” the UWM Clubs and Events website.

## Project Overview

In the vibrant landscape of university life, countless events unfold every day. Yet, amidst the flurry of homework and exams, many of these opportunities slip unnoticed. Our project aims to bridge this gap by elevating the visibility of campus events, thereby enriching the university experience for both current and prospective students.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to develop a user-friendly digital platform that not only showcases the diverse array of events on campus but also fosters a sense of community and engagement among the student body. Consolidating events to once central place. Through this initiative, we aspire to:

- Enhance the discoverability of events, ensuring no opportunity goes unseen.
- Foster greater student participation, contributing to a more vibrant campus culture.
- Create a centralized hub for all campus activities, making information accessible and convenient.

## Technology Stack

Leveraging our skills in Computer Science, we've carefully selected a robust technology stack to build a reliable and scalable solution. Our choices reflect current industry standards and best practices, ensuring our project's longevity and adaptability.
- Django
- Bootstrap
- Python 

## Collaboration and Contributions

This project is a collaborative effort, bringing together the diverse talents and perspectives of our senior class. We invite fellow students, faculty, and stakeholders to contribute their ideas and feedback, making this a truly inclusive and community-driven endeavor.

## Final Thoughts

As we navigate the final year of our undergraduate journey, this Capstone Project represents not just a culmination of our learning but also a contribution to the university that has been our academic home. We're excited to see the positive impact our project will have on student engagement and campus life at UWM.
